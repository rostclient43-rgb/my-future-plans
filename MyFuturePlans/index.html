            <p>According to research from <a href="https://capd.mit.edu/resources/make-a-career-plan/" class="external-link" target="_blank">MIT Career Advising & Professional Development</a>, a career plan lists short- and long-term career goals and the actions you can take to achieve them. Career plans can help you make decisions about what classes to take and identify extracurricular activities that will strengthen your candidacy.</p>

            <h3>Why Future Planning Matters</h3>
            <p>Setting goals gives us direction and purpose. As highlighted by <a href="https://reclaim.ai/blog/personal-development-goals" class="external-link" target="_blank">Reclaim.ai</a>, personal development goals are targets for self-improvement that help us become better, more well-rounded individuals.

            <h2>The Foundation of Success: Setting SMART Goals</h2>
            <p>One of the most effective frameworks for goal-setting is the SMART methodology. According to <a href="https://capd.mit.edu/resources/make-a-career-plan/" class="external-link" target="_blank">MIT's Career Planning Guide</a>, SMART goals are:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Specific</strong> — Identify your goal clearly and specifically</li>
                <li><strong>Measurable</strong> — Include clear criteria to determine progress and accomplishment</li>
                <li><strong>Attainable</strong> — The goal should have a 50 percent or greater chance of success</li>
                <li><strong>Relevant</strong> — The goal is important and relevant to you</li>
                <li><strong>Time-bound</strong> — Commit to a specific timeframe</li>
            </ul>
